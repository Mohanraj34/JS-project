# TaskFlow


Minimal daily task manager built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.


**Highlights:**
- Demonstrates DOM manipulation, event delegation, `localStorage`, `setInterval`, `Date` handling and JSON.
- No external libraries (meets assignment constraints).
- Single-page app style — easy to host on GitHub Pages or any static host.


## How to run
1. Place the `src/` folder in a static host or open `src/index.html` in your browser.
2. Add tasks, mark complete, filter by Today / Upcoming.


## Extensions (ideas)
- Add task descriptions and edit them in a modal.
- Add categories/tags and filter by tag.
- Export/Import tasks JSON.
- Sync with a simple backend later (Node + MongoDB) for cross-device sync.
